As my first Java project, I decided to build a game called Floppy Fish. It's a spinoff of Flappy Bird, except it's a floppy fish. Instead of gravity doing its thing by pulling the bird down, instead, the fish floats. This means that pressing the space bar helps the fish dive/swim deeper.

The goal of the game is to go through as many pipes as possible. If a pipe is hit, then you'll the fish dies, and you'll need to start over at 0, but the highest score is kept on the top right (the current score can be found on the top left). If the surface of the water or the bottom-most part of the ocean floor is hit, then the fish dies.

Game sounds should accompany the game (if everything goes accordingly). I created, using pixelArt, what's supposed to be a little red fish. However, my artistic abilities are not that good, so the fish looks a little funky. I changed the background to show an underwater landscape, but I kept the pipes true to the original Flappy Bird.

I'd like to add more sound effects as well as fancier level changes to the game in the future.

I modified the code from ImKennyYip (https://github.com/ImKennyYip/flappy-bird) and added my additional features.

Hope you enjoy Floppy Fish! :)
